# Snake-game
This is the basic implementation of the Snake game written in Python.

#Rules
1. Don't run the snake into the wall, or his own tail: you die.
2. Use your cursor keys: up, left, right, and down.
3. Eat the colored apples to gain points.
4. Higher (and faster) play levels award more points.
