# Snake-game
This is a basic implementation of the Snake game written in Python.

# Rules
1. When snake crosses itself or runs into the wall, the game will over.
2. Use your cursor keys: up, left, right, and down.
3. Eat the colored apples to gain points.
4. Higher (and faster) play levels award more points.
5. The game is over when the snake bumps into one of the edges of the screen or accidently eat himself.
